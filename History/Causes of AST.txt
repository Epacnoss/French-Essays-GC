The Slave Trade was abolished in 1807, but was it just William Wilberforce as lots of sources say. Key areas to look at are William
Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson and the Business side of things.

Firstly, Thomas Clarkson. Firstly, to help spread the word of the cause and how horrible the Slave Trade was, he travelled thousands of miles a year to speak to the public. He even worked out that a large part of his audience was illiterate and so often brought real objects like Thumb Screws and Feeding Tubes, as well as digrams like Brookes Ship. Secondly, while he was doing these trips, he also kept up the morale of the Quakers, who created the Society for the Aboliton of the Slave Trade in the first place, and because of their beliefs, they may have been beaten up three or four times in a year. So, by the 1780s, the Slave Trade was a large talking point, as shown by the fact that before the 1780s very few debating societies talked about slaves, yet by the 1780s 1 in 3 talks were about it. However, this was the public opinion and not that of Parliament. That was when Thomas Clarkson recruited William Wilberforce.

At first, William Wilberforce was reluctant, but he ended up spending the rest of his life speaking for the cause. At first, he tried to speak to the MP's hearts which partially failed, because a large proportion of Parliament was part of the West India Lobby, a group that would always vote positive about the Slave Trade as they were paid to. Eventually, though he learnt to 'play the game', and spoke to the MPs with facts, rather than preaching to the deaf. He got in one bill, following a tactic from his brother-in-law James Stephen, saying that they shoud stop selling slaves to the French colonies as they were in a war with France. This got through, as the West India Lobby had to vote for it, as they would look unpatriotic otherwise, and 70% of the Slave Trade dissapeared instantly. His brother, William Pitt the youger, was also the Prime Minister and did everything he could to help. Overall, he changed the opinion of Parliament while Thomas Clarkson changed the opinion of the People.

There was also a business side to it though. Firstly, cheaper sugar without any slaves use in its production was starting to appear from Brazil. This convinced the businessmen, as it was cheaper and also that the people liked it more. There was also the danger of a slave revolt. Toussiant L'Overture, took the French colony of St. Dominigue and renamed it to Haiti. Britain tried to take it from them, and lost many years and hundreds of thousands of soliders. So why trade slaves, if there is a possibility of not only it being cheaper and more popular with the people as well as there being a danger of death.

To conclude, while Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce were certainly important in the Abolition, they just slowed it down a bit, while the business side, stopped it. Without the business side however, Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce would have eventually abolished the Slave Trade and Slavery, just business speeded it up.
