In the French Revoloution, there was a lot of change, but what caused it? Key areas to focus on are the Ancien Regime, the Short Term Discomfort and the New Ideas.

Firstly, the Ancien Regime and the Esates System. Firstly, the Middle Class at the top of the 3rd Estate, were not allowed the very top jobs, like judge and general even though they were arguably much smarter than the actual judges and the actual generals. Next, was the justice system, which unfairly discriminated against 3rd Estate in that in any case with a 2nd Estate member and a 3rd Estate member, the 2nd Estate member would win. There was also no hope of changing any of this, because all 3 Estates had equal representation at the National Assembly, even thoug the 3rd Estate had about 98% of the population at the time. This meant that any ideas about anything negative for the first 2 Estates would get ruled over. The tax system was also unfair, in that a peasant paid 85% of his earnings in taxes, and they also paid local tax and church tax. The 1st and 2nd Estate however paid nothing. So to sum up, the 3rd Estate was unhappy.

There was also a period of short-term dicsomfort before the revoloution. Firstly, there were food shortages due to bad harvests, which meant both that many people died. To try to solve this, the peasants of France stopped using contaraception in order to have as many babies as possible in that hope that at least one would survive. However, this only made the problem worse due to having more mouths to feed. Part of the reason that people couldn't buy food, was that France was in debt due to war with England and helping the Americans start a country in the American Revoloution. The people however, did not see this, but they did see lots of money being spent on the Royal Family whilst people were dying. To sum up, the French could not eat, and as once said 'When the belly is empty, the mind is full of dangerous ideas'.

Finally, was that a lot of new ideas were coming from the likes of Voltaire. These ideas were that power could be used not as a show, but to help other people, that the Church did not need to be the chief opinion former and that things did not have to stay as they were. The French also helped the American Revoloution, and the General Lafayette saw that a free country could work and the estates could be united without th country falling to Anarchy. This showed the French that things could change and that it could work.

Someone once said that a revoloution is caused by a period of long-term unhappiness followed by a short period of a short-term problem. The problem then ends when the revoloution happens. The French had all of this and proof that it could work. With all of this, there is no way the 1st and 2nd Estates could have stopped it with their 300,000 people who were used to delegating to now gone 3rd Estate members.
