In the French Reveloution, there was a lot of change, but what caused it? Key areas to focus on are the Ancien Regime, the Short Term Discomfort and the New Ideas.

Firstly, the Ancien Regime and the Esates System. Firstly, the Middle Class at the top of the 3rd Estate, were not allowed the very top jobs, like judge and general even though they were arguably much smarter than the actual judges and the actual generals. Next, was the justice system, which unfairly discriminated against 3rd Estate in that in any case with a 2nd Estate member and a 3rd Estate member, the 2nd Estate member would win. There was also no hope of changing any of this, because all 3 Estates had equal representation at the National Assembly, even thoug the 3rd Estate had about 98% of the population at the time. This meant that any ideas about anything negative for the first 2 Estates would get ruled over. The tax system was also unfair, in that a peasant paid 85% of his earnings in taxes, and they also paid local tax and church tax. The 1st and 2nd Estate however paid nothing.
