Question: 'How important was William Wilberforce  in the Abolition of The Slave Trade'

Many people argue that William Wilberforce was the driving force for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, and that without him it would never have happened, but if he had disagreed, and Thomas Clarkson had to find a different MP, would the Slave Trade still have been abolished? Key areas to look at are Thomas Clarkson, and William Wilberforce.

Firstly, Thomas Clarkson was most definitely one of the key driving forces of the revolution. Firstly, was that he encouraged the Quakers, the people who had started the revolution in the first place, as they may have been beaten up three or four times per year. The confidence required to keep going, was only sustained by Thomas Clarkson. Thomas Clarkson, also travelled thousands of miles to educate the public on the Slave Trade. He even worked out that a lot of his audience was illiterate, and so he created diagrams like Brookes Ship.  His nickname was the 'Moral Steam Engine'. So to sum up, he was brilliant at convincing the people, however he was not an MP and so could not convince parliament.

However, William Wilberforce was an MP, and while he started trying to appeal to parliament's better nature, he eventually became a good orator. After Thomas Clarkson convinced him to join the cause, he spent the rest of his life on it. Firstly, his brother William Pitt the younger was the Prime Minister at the time, and whenever he could he helped his brother. However, other than being an MP, he did not do much, and if his reputation had not been ensured by his sons, would he still have committed to the cause.
