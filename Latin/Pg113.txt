Test 9

It was a long journey. However at last after many dangers Perseus arrived at the land, where Medusa was living. Although Medusa fought bravely, he killed her with the help of the gods (there is an 'et' in the passage but there is nowhere that it makes sense). When he had done this, he cut her head off and went back to the island (there is perfect, but it feels like an pluperfect).
