# Part 2 - Part 1 on Paper

## SECTION A - BIOLOGY

### Question 2
#### d)
On average, city foxes in London and Bristol scavenge about 49.6% of their food and about 6.4% of their food is pets, which are normally domesticated and would therefore be easier to catch and eat. Unlike the wild foxes, however the city foxes also eat fruit which accounts for about 9% of their diet. 

#### e)i))
London foxes scavenge for about 34.8% of their food with about two thirds of that being scavenged meat, and while they do eat about 8% fruit, the rest is all meat, killed and eaten. Bristol foxes however, scavenge about 64.3% of their food accounting for a majority meaning that they would actaully kill creatures much less.

#### e)ii))
If you have a pet in London or Bristol, I would reccomend that if it is small or has very little in way of defense that it stays inside at night and day and goes outside, supervised or at the heat of the day when night foxes are likely sleeping. If, however your creature is bigger like a big dog or a cat, it may be fine to let them out all day and that if they get left out at night, they have a fair chance of coming out. However, all of this is not to say not to let them out, but that when foxes do come (however rarely) they can be vicous and dangerous.

#### e)iii)
The foxes may be common in that area of Bristol, as Bristol foxes like to scavenge their food (accounting for about two thirds of the diet), and if a restaurant throws out food outside the foxes may discover this, and live or go there often. This trait is passed down through generations and eventaully due to lots of food the foxes may thrive there and become commonplace.

## SECTION B - CHEMISTRY
### Question 1
#### a)
Zinc Sphalerite + Oxygen ---> Zinc Oxide + Sulphur Dioxide

#### b)i))
Zinc Oxide + Carbon ---> Zinc + Carbon Dioxide

#### b)ii)
This tells us that Carbon is more reactive than (had to check notes) the Zinc. This is shown by the fact that the Carbon is displacing the Zinc from the Oxygen.

#### c)i))
Hydrgogen

#### c)ii))
Zinc Chloride

#### c)iii))
0.2g = 74cm3,
 = * 0.2 by (100 / 74),
 = 0.270g

#### d)i))
The same mass of zinc can only produce the same volume of hydrogen.

#### d)ii))
However, as it was finely powdered, there is more surface area for the reaction to occur meaning that it will speed up.

#### e)
If one were to just paint the car, eventually the paint would come off and the car would rust. However, if you galvanise it, then the zinc will always react instead of the iron, meaning that the iron will never rust.

#### f)
To test whether it is pure gold, you could test some of the properties such as the unreactiveness or how malleable it is, but the best way would be to heat it until it melts or boils, as any change in the composition would change this.

#### g)
 = 0.001g * 365.25,
 = 0.365g

#### h)
Water is at pH 7, which means that it is neutral. howver there are very strong acids in the stomach which can dissplve the zinc.

### Question 2

#### a)
Sodium Carbonate + Hydrochloric Acid ---> Carbon Dioxide + Water + Sodium Chloride

#### b)i))
The test for carbon dioxide is to bubble through limewater which reacts with the carbon dioxide and it makes the limewater go cloudy.

#### b)ii))
On The Paper

#### c)
The burining splint will go out as the carbon dioxide starves it of oxygen.

#### d)i))
If the acid was in excess, that means that there was more than enough acid to react with all of the sodium carbonate.

#### d)ii)
Drop some pH Universal Indicator into it after the reaction and it should turn red or orange which indicates that it is an acid.

#### e)i))
 = 3.1g (????????????????????)

#### e)ii))
??????????????????????????????

#### e)iii))
The average would be the best number to use for this calculation as otherwise the result you use may be an anomaly and you would not realise it.

#### f)i))
If carbon dioxide is soluble, then the results afterwards changed as the carbon dioxide would have had to have been included in the results??

####  f)ii))
No idea...

## SECTION C - PHYSICS
### Question 1

#### a)i))
C

#### a)ii))
The incident ray changes direction to become B, as the parts of the light enter the glass at different times and end up refracting.

#### b)
Ray A is just a small amount of light that managed to reflect of the front of the glass rather than Ray D where it actually reflected of a mirror.

#### c)
Two images.

#### d)i))
One advantage is that this means that there is only ever going to be one image (excluding refraction through the atmosphere) which is easier to look at or examine.

#### d)ii)
One advantage is that the glass protects the mirror and that the mirror does not get scratched which reflects back clearer.

#### e)
The night time ray, is just the ray that reflected off of the glass rather than being reflected of the mirror.

#### f)i))
The driver sees a dim image of the road behind as some of the light reflected off other things???

#### f)ii))
idk.

#### g)i))
For a greater field of view for the driver??

#### g)ii))
So that it appears normal to the driver?

### Question 2

#### a)
Electricty ---> Light and Thermal Energy

#### b)
The percentage of the electricty used going to Light Energy

#### c)
These two are the least efficient, and if we are to save the environment and to stop climate change then we must be as efficient as possible. It is also cheaper for the electricty bills, if less energy is being used on lights.

#### d)
Firstly, coal. Coal is burnt to heat water, which boils to spin a turbine which makes electricity via a generator. However, this does produce carbon dioxide. Natural Gas is also used for this but it burns cleaner.

#### e)
Firstly, nuclear power. Radioactive substances produce heat, which can be used to heat water and turn a turbine. However, the danger is that it goes into meltdown and releases radioactive fallout, and that when it is spent, it cannot be used, but is a danger to people for thousands of years. This is only to be used as an intermediary between coal and things like hydroelectric generators. This is when water flows through a dam, and directly spins turbines as it goes through. Disadvantages include that an area has to be flooded for the resevoir behind the dam and that if the dam collapses lots of people would die in an induced tsunami.

#### f)i)) 
= 0.22 / 200 = 0.0011A per light.

#### f)ii))
Current is the same throughout so,
 = 0.1A per light.

#### h)
This tell us that the LED lights require much less power per light??

#### i)
Yes, as LEDs are about 13 times as efficent as Filament bulbs, so more power would go to brightness or Light Energy
